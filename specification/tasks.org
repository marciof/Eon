* TODO avoid prototypical inheritance

- explain `prototype` is like cloning and modifying (dictionary definition), with no persistent link to the parent/original
- it does "know" the “parent” type (confusing distinction?)

* TODO lexical binding by default for safety?

* TODO improve documentation

- be succinct, avoid fluff
- lexical and dynamic scope example (explain how `bindings` in fn lists affect their scope)
- function naming example (1st key is the name, 1st value is the body/a fn), eg. `\(incr: + x 1)`
- use only: must, should, may?
- add references to each section, where needed, for prior art? https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/671
- in examples, should the resulting output of each expression be `repr`-like?
- https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Building-KeePassXC
- Function sub headings? Examples and conditions per section
- Language code snippet example right on the front page
- Runnable examples, eg. https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- start a changelog? (and do releases?) https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
- avoid too many abbreviations

* TODO visual grammar diagram?

- Railroad Diagram Generator
- http://lua4z.com/doc/manual/syntax.md.html

* TODO build target to lint/validate CommonMark documents

* TODO indentation based syntax grammar

- https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html
- https://devguide.python.org/compiler/
- accept keyword arguments on indented lines as well? (use parenthesis to force a function call, as it‘s a more uniform syntax?)

* TODO optional static typing?

* TODO avoid `do` as a built-in?

* TODO avoid separate map syntax?

- too easy to confuse with sets?
- if using static typing with inference it would be less of a problem?

* TODO shell pipeline syntax?

- "Pipelines Support Vectorized, Point-Free, and Imperative Style", https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/01/15.html

* TODO support for streaming, iterators, delayed collections?

- stdlib or core?
- could be useful for shell pipelines?
- `next` is an iterator?
- generator expressions? JS yield?

* TODO make List extend Function? easily merge arg lists into fns?

* TODO replace exceptions/conditions/continuations with optionals?

- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html
- http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/

* TODO generalize `:` and `.` to multiple elements?

- would enable more uses, eg. `127.0.0.1`, `12:45:00`
- too much added syntax?

* TODO multiline nesting comments? triple quotes?

- Language ergonomics shouldn't need an IDE?

* TODO make `count` throw an error for built-ins or foreign values?

* TODO have a generic `splice`? = insert + merge + delete

- decouple `insert`? setting from displacing

* TODO attempt to unify data types?

- numbers are symbols that evaluate to themselves
- booleans are numbers restricted to either 0 or 1
- maps are the root
- merge lists/arrays with function lists? `[]` `()`

* TODO verify soundness of Text

- Unicode/string/text/char/bytes support
- Rust String/Grapheme, <https://tildes.net/~comp/9t9/utf_8_everywhere#comment-2hai>

* TODO are decimals under-specified?

- exactness of floating point math, https://0.30000000000000004.com
- math numerals vs number and representations, eg. 0.999 = 1, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23004086

* TODO syntax for complex numbers?

- Surreal numbers? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number
- number tower like Scheme? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_numbers

* TODO syntax for fractions?

* TODO syntax for imaginary numbers?

* TODO more Map subtypes?

- bidirectional map?
- sorted map?

* TODO numerical tower? with syntax?

- (prototype 0) # non-neg int
- (prototype 1) # positive int
- (prototype -1) # int
- (prototype 0.0) # non-neg decimal
- (prototype 1.0) # positive decimal
- (prototype -1.0) # decimal
- (prototype 1.(3)) # real
- (prototype 1+2i) # imaginary?

* TODO how to expose language metadata?

- line number
- column number
- size of maps
- type of values
- prototypes
- number numerator, denominator

* TODO version vs feature detection

- https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Feature-Detection-Is-Better-than-Version-Detection

* TODO FEXPRs: "Special Forms in Lisp", https://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Special-Forms.html

- macros instead of fexprs?
- arguments for quoted parameters aren’t automatically evaluated, but unquoted are?
- could allows early returns?
- could replace exceptions?
- potentially more performant?
- have quasi-quote and unquote?
- should `defer`'s `escape` accept multiple arguments?

* TODO Clojure change and state, http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Identity-State-Rich-Hickey

* TODO "Empirical Analysis of Programming Language Adoption", Leo A. Meyerovich, Ariel Rabkin: http://sns.cs.princeton.edu/docs/asr-oopsla13.pdf

* TODO "Dealing with Properties", Martin Fowler, https://www.martinfowler.com/apsupp/properties.pdf

* TODO evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively

- Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
- Can the language itself/concepts be simplified without sacrificing readability and flexibility?
- Use easier synonyms for hard to type words?
- Bulk analyze source code out there.
- Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.
