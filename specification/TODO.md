- Document collection operations on texts and symbols, and module loading syntax errors.
- More specific parameters and return value documentation.
- Indicate time and space complexity for each operation and data type.
- Document any side-effects for each operation and data type.
- Specify prototypical inheritance (differential inheritance, eg. intro, `get` `put` and `remove` handling, etc). http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html
- Rename `debug` to `rescue` for something similar to Common Lisp conditions (signaling a condition, handling it, and restarting).
  - The specification doesn't dictate how it's handled, but the core library uses continuations to implement a full condition system?
  - Add a `continuation` built-in to create (escape?) continuations?
  - Make `rescue` calls very specific, eg. `(rescue 'illegal-argument function: get parameter: 'map argument: 123)`

- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words.
  - Avoid verbs that are also nouns.
  - Bulk analyze source code out there for analysis?
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.

- Look for best/worst features of other languages: JavaScript, Clojure, Kotlin, Python, Haskell, Erlang, PureScript, Elm, Io, Rust, Ruby, Smalltalk, Java, Scheme, Go, ML, Lua, Haxe, Tcl, Shen, Matlab, R, REBOL, Wolfram.
  - "Perl Pocket Reference"
- Stdlib: regex, math, io, json, xml, csv, yaml, ini
- Open questions:
  - Live changes (hot-reloading) support.
  - Abbreviate longer built-in names? Eg. `eval`, `proto`, `ref`, `inf`?
  - Optional static typing?
  - Change `load` to allow specifying a language/type to make it part of the spec that it has hooks for FFI? It's more practical and realistic, and also enables using native parts of a OS runtime. Allow a string so that anything works? URLs, etc
  - Indentation based, significant white-space? Useful for using the REPL as a shell itself.
  - Add `has?` built-in or let it be defined through conditions? Performance?
  - Add fraction literal syntax? More practical? Or just use number suffix functions named `/2`, `/3`, etc?
  - Allow suffixes in tagged text literals? Unnecessarily complicated? No good use-cases?
  - Allow Get Chain expressions to contain numbers? `names::1`
  - Built-in concurrency?
  - Add a built-in CAS (Computer Algebra System) to not loose any precision even when dealing with irrational numbers? Make math functions allow symbols? Would also allow to remove `infinity` as a built-in, using the sum of the harmonic series? (See Maxima Algebra System, which uses Lisp.)
