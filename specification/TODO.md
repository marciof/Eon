- Allow the concept of a "code block" when a keyword argument is on a line just by itself followed by indented lines?
  - It's the type of a module since it can have one or more expressions?
  - Default arguments? As prototype binding? More orthogonal and reusable?
  - Have a built-in `do` which is what's used at the top level that allows modules to have a sequence of expressions?
- Specify the empty function more accurately. 
  - Does it accept parameters or not?
  - Accepting parameters allows it to easily be used as catch-all no-op.
  - What value does it return?
  - Does it evaluate all arguments and return the last one or itself when empty? Too confusing?
  - What's the overlap with `do`?
  - Allow `do` to not receive anything? Eg. do nothing?
- Define indentation based syntax grammar.
  - Is a keyword parameter in a separate indented line part of the enclosing function call or the function call in the same line? To be consistent with the non-indented style it should be part of the enclosing function call.

- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words?
  - Bulk analyze source code out there.
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.
