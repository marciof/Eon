- Add built-in `do`, that accepts one or more arguments, evaluates all of them, and returns the last one.
- Specify how modules are able to have more than one expression, by using `do`.
- When a keyword argument is on a line just by itself followed by indented lines:
  - Default arguments? As prototype binding? Using `do`? More orthogonal and reusable?
  - Default to a "code block" using `do` like modules? Less clear?
- Define indentation based syntax grammar.
  - Is a keyword parameter in a separate indented line part of the enclosing function call or the function call in the same line? To be consistent with the non-indented style it should be part of the enclosing function call.

- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words?
  - Bulk analyze source code out there.
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.
