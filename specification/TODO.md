- Syntax for parameter spec in functions?
  - `(function [x y] (+ x y))`
  - `\([x y]: + x y))`
  - `(map numbers \(x: * x 2))`
- Specify prototypical inheritance (differential inheritance, eg. intro, `get`, `insert` and `remove` handling, etc): http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html
- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words.
  - Bulk analyze source code out there for analysis?
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.

- Look for best/worst features of other languages: Wren, Perl, F#, Matlab, Rust, Ruby, Go, Julia, JavaScript, Clojure, Kotlin, Python, Haskell, Erlang, Typed Racket, PureScript, Elm, Io, Smalltalk, Java, Scheme, ML, Lua, Haxe, Tcl, Shen, REBOL, Mathematica, HyperCard, Awk, Parabola.io, GNU Octave, Maxima Algebra System
- Indentation based syntax? The REPL becomes the shell, it just adds global functions as commands and other niceties.
  - If a line starts with a parenthesis it disables significant indentation inside the entire expression.
  - Otherwise each new line is a function call, with same-line arguments passed as-is, and indented new lines passed as function calls, unless it's a keyword argument.
  - All data types are callable as functions, and except for functions each value returns itself as the result.
- Guarantee efficient self-recursive function calls, tail function calls, and self-tail function calls?
