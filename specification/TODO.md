- Define the module loading process, how it's similar to a function call, and how the module name and arguments are available in the bindings map.
- Like OCaml, make it statically typed, but made type annotations entirely optional, since they're inferred. Can still use a `Any` data type to selectively disable static typing?
- Specify prototypical inheritance (differential inheritance, eg. intro, `get`, `insert` and `remove` handling, etc): http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html
- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words.
  - Bulk analyze source code out there for analysis?
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.

- Look for best/worst features of other languages: OCaml, C, Common Lisp, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Scheme, Java, Clojure, Kotlin, Wren, F#, Matlab, Rust, Ruby, Go, Julia, Haskell, Erlang, Typed Racket, PureScript, Elm, Io, Smalltalk, ML, Lua, Haxe, Tcl, Shen, REBOL, Mathematica, HyperCard, Awk, Parabola.io, GNU Octave, Maxima Algebra System
- Indentation based syntax? The REPL becomes the shell, it just adds global functions as commands and other niceties.
  - If a line starts with a parenthesis it disables significant indentation inside the entire expression.
  - Otherwise each new line is a function call, with same-line arguments passed as-is, and indented new lines passed as function calls, unless it's a keyword argument.
  - All data types are callable as functions, and except for functions each value returns itself as the result.
- Guarantee efficient self-recursive function calls, tail function calls, and self-tail function calls?
