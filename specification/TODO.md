- Remove unnecessary parenthesis from examples to keep things simple and promote indentation based syntax.
- Mention that maps, lists and sets aren't affected by significant indentation. Mention that the starting open parenthesis is for a function.
- Guarantee efficient self-recursive function calls, tail function calls, and self-tail function calls?
- Since every non-function is callable as a zero-parameter function, what's the error if one or more arguments are passed? Document that in the specification for each data type.
- Define grammar for indentation based syntax.

- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words?
  - Bulk analyze source code out there.
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.
