- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words?
  - Bulk analyze source code out there.
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.

- Look for best/worst features of other languages: OCaml, C, Common Lisp, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Scheme, Smalltalk, Java, Clojure, Self, Kotlin, Wren, F#, Matlab, Rust, Ruby, Go, Julia, Haskell, Erlang, Elixir, Typed Racket, PureScript, Elm, Io, ML, Lua, Haxe, Tcl, Shen, REBOL, Mathematica, HyperCard, Awk, Parabola.io, GNU Octave, Maxima Algebra System, Pascal, R
- Guarantee efficient self-recursive function calls, tail function calls, and self-tail function calls?
- Since every non-function is callable as a zero-parameter function, what's the error if one or more arguments are passed?
- Define grammar for indentation based syntax.
- Are keyword arguments handled differently in indented new lines in indentation based syntax?
