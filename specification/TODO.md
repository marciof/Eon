- Modules are an implicit function call to the built-in `do`, and therefore allow one or more expressions at the top-level. After loading a module, but before evaluating it, the call to `do` can be replaced with a sort of `do*` that behaves similarly to `let*` to give the illusion of side-effects when defining top-level constants and functions.
- Add a build target to validate Markdown documents (and code documentation) as valid CommonMark.
- Define indentation based syntax grammar.
  - Is a keyword parameter in a separate indented line part of the enclosing function call or the function call in the same line? To be consistent with the non-indented style it should be part of the enclosing function call.
  - When a keyword argument is on a line just by itself followed by indented lines.
  - Default arguments? As prototype binding? Using `do`? More orthogonal and reusable?
  - Default to a "code block" using `do` like modules? Less clear?

- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words?
  - Bulk analyze source code out there.
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.
