- Indicate time and space complexity for remove, insert and prototype.
- Specify prototypical inheritance (differential inheritance, eg. intro, `get`, `put` and `remove` handling, etc): http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html
- Evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.
  - Use easier synonyms for hard to type words.
  - Bulk analyze source code out there for analysis?
  - Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.

- Look for best/worst features of other languages: Perl, F#, Matlab, Rust, Ruby, Go, Julia, JavaScript, Clojure, Kotlin, Python, Haskell, Erlang, Typed Racket, PureScript, Elm, Io, Smalltalk, Java, Scheme, ML, Lua, Haxe, Tcl, Shen, REBOL, Wolfram, HyperCard, Awk, Parabola.io
- Open questions:
  - Reactive programming.
  - Live changes (hot-reloading) support.
  - Change `load` to allow specifying a language/type to make it part of the spec that it has hooks for FFI? It's more practical and realistic, and also enables using native parts of a OS runtime. Allow a string so that anything works? URLs, etc
  - Indentation based syntax? The REPL becomes the shell, it just adds global functions as commands and other niceties.
    - If a line starts with a parenthesis it disables significant indentation inside the entire expression.
    - Otherwise each new line is a function call, with same-line arguments passed as-is, and indented new lines passed as function calls, unless it's a keyword argument.
    - All data types are callable as functions, and except for functions each value returns itself as the result.
  - Allow suffixes in tagged text literals? Unnecessarily complicated? No good use-cases? Flags for regular expressions?
  - Built-in concurrency?
  - Guarantee efficient self-recursive function calls, tail function calls, and self-tail function calls?
  - Add a built-in CAS (Computer Algebra System) to not loose any precision even when dealing with irrational numbers? Make math functions allow symbols? Would also allow to remove `infinity` as a built-in, using the sum of the harmonic series? (See Maxima Algebra System which uses Lisp, and GNU Octave.)
