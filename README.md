# Checklist #

- Keep it simple, practical and concise.
- Make right things easy (easier than wrong things), encouraged, and the only way.
- Principle of Least Surprise: "The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and mental models."
- "Zero-one-infinity rule": no arbitrary limits.
- Prefer flat over nested. (Eg. prefer object composition over class inheritance.)
- No undefined behavior.
- "A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant." (Alan Perlis).
- Low cognitive load and typing difficulty (US keyboard layout, prefer home row keys).
