# Checklist #

- Keep it simple and practical.
- Make right things easy (easier than wrong things), encouraged, and the only way.
- Principle of Least Surprise: "The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and mental models."
- "Zero-one-infinity rule": no arbitrary limits.
- Prefer flat over nested. (Eg. prefer object composition over class inheritance.)
- No undefined behavior.
