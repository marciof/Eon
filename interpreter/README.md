# To Do #

- Tests, coverage, lint, static analysis, continuous integration, memory check.
  - Automation: Vagrant, Docker
  - https://autotest.github.io
  - https://scan.coverity.com
  - https://travis-ci.org
  - https://github.com/andrewrk/malcheck
  - https://github.com/google/sanitizers
  - http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org
- Clean up, simplify (make all filenames lower-case, hpp headers, remove double blank lines), remove useless TODO comments and documentation (document only what's need, eg. log's format string grammar), use single-line comments, remove `this->`.
- Colored native logging.
- Drop Windows support.
- Logging of long integers.
- Make warnings fatal.
- Drop x86 support and switch to x64.
  - ASFLAGS += -f elf64
  - CCFLAGS += -m64
  - LINKFLAGS += -m elf_x86_64
- Upgrade to Multiboot 2.
- Use exceptions to reduce coupling between components? Eg. no need to call System::stop() directly, calls to Log::error() will throw an exception.
- Memory management:

  - http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/gdt.htm
- Cleanup Scheme:
  - Simple functional tests with Valgrind.
  - Fix no output when cwd isn't the source code path.
  - Move library to a separate directory.
  - Compile as C++.
  - Use readline.
  - Reformat indentation.
  - Consistent naming.
  - `#pragma once`
