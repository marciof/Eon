- Clean up, abbreviate a bit more since C is verbose, remove leading underscore in static data, simplify, remove double blank lines, more flat less nested, remove useless documentation (document only what's need), remove stop modes and use only reset or halt.
- Let each host provide a (semi-)working C stdlib that "core" can rely on. More familiar and easier to use external libraries? Use Newlib? (libnewlib-dev) Check license first.

- Redesign architecture, to make it easier to embed, no singletons, and easier to unit test:
  - Avoid all these repeated calls for `*_get()`?
  - // dynamic (eg. native, multiple interpreters)
  - System_new(Log, Memory, argc, argv)
  - // static, not part of the interface, it's up to each host
  - System_get(Log, Memory, argc, argv)
  - //
  - System_stop(System)
  - //
  - main(multiboot_magic_num, multiboot_info)
- Build native host layer by default with option to switch.
- Make it more resilient, warn instead of aborting.
- Add location to log calls? function, file, line? Or to warnings and errors only?
- Add color to native logging.
- Use `grub-file` to verify kernel image is bootable.
- Test on Windows, Debian 32-bit (check again 64-bit dependencies on a pristine image, and document).
  - See `.travis.yml` for details.
  - Tested on Debian 9 64-bit.
  - i386 testing: `apt install grub-common grub-pc-bin xorriso mtools virtualbox-5.1`
- Tests (unit, functional), coverage, lint, static analysis, continuous integration, memory check (Valgrind).
  - Automation: Vagrant, Docker?

- Colored native logging.
- Logging of long integers.
- Add support for "amd64"?
  - ASFLAGS += -f elf64
  - CCFLAGS += -m64
  - LINKFLAGS += -m elf_x86_64
- Upgrade to Multiboot 2?
- https://github.com/copy/v86
- Prototyping:
  - lexical analysis: Lexer, Tokenizer, Scanner / syntax analysis: Parser, Syntax Tree, Parse Tree
  - Start adding unit tests.
  - Add `getopt` with help screen, options, and version.
  - Add flag option to print token stream.
  - Add flag option for `-e` expressions.
  - Add verbose option, print func/file/line on errors only in debug mode.
  - Add few functional high-level black-box language tests, eg. input "(+ 1 2)", translate to JavaScript, run, output "3". (Or even with the token stream option alone as well). With Valgrind.
  - C frontend, JavaScript backend: can reuse frontend and AST for the final version, and with JavaScript it's easy to get something running.
  - Add requirements one by one, even if with limitations (eg. no fully unlimited precision arithmetic at first): immutable collections, Unicode text, prototypical inheritance, first class scope, unlimited precision arithmetic, homoiconic, unevaluated arguments.
  - Improve interpreter step by step: REPL, local/remote debugger, stdin/stdout filter.
  - When done with JavaScript backend, start translating to PicoLisp (or even ECL, Common Lisp, Clojure) since it can be embedded (verify first), and reuse the tests written previously.
  - Skip translation and interpret directly. Look to PicoLisp for inspiration. Maybe still leave translation in as an option, especially if to JavaScript since that also makes the browser another possible host and can be useful (lower barrier to entry and also ability to use a single language full-stack).

    - GNU MP / MPFR
  - Finally integrate with the "core" hooks so that it works with any host layer available.
