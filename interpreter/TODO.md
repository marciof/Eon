  - Start adding unit tests.
  - Add `getopt` with help screen, options, and version.
  - Add flag option to print token stream.
  - Add flag option for `-e` expressions.
  - Add verbose option, print func/file/line on errors only in debug mode.
  - Add few functional high-level opaque-box language tests, eg. input "(+ 1 2)", translate to JavaScript, run, output "3". (Or even with the token stream option alone as well). With Valgrind.
  - Add requirements one by one, even if with limitations (eg. no fully unlimited precision arithmetic at first): immutable collections, Unicode text, prototypical inheritance, first class scope, unlimited precision arithmetic, homoiconic, unevaluated arguments.
  - When done with JavaScript backend, start translating to PicoLisp (or even ECL, Common Lisp, Clojure) since it can be embedded (verify first), and reuse the tests written previously.
  - Skip translation and interpret directly. Look to PicoLisp for inspiration. Maybe still leave translation in as an option, especially if to JavaScript since that also makes the browser another possible host and can be useful (lower barrier to entry and also ability to use a single language full-stack).
  - Finally integrate with the "core" hooks so that it works with any host layer available.
