* TODO use a license that prevents abuse from cloud services, eg. SaaS

- clear terminology: FLOSS (free, libre, and open source software)
- GLP/AGPL with Commons Clause?

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21564638, "The GPL has always been criticized for its definition of distribution, which allows companies to host SaaS offerings of GPL software without having to make their modifications available. Hosting a GPL-licensed server and receiving network activity does not constitute distribution, which is why the AGPL exists."

* TODO check licensing of all libraries, tools, dependencies

- compile list in a text file

* TODO improve documentation

- Make `count` throw an error for built-ins or foreign values?
- Function sub headings
- Examples and conditions per section
- Ensure floating point math is exact by default, https://0.30000000000000004.com

* TODO multiline nesting comments?

- Language ergonomics shouldn't need an IDE?

* TODO optional static typing?

- Algebraic data types? Check ML languages.

* TODO syntax for complex numbers?

* TODO syntax for fractions?

* TODO build target to lint/validate CommonMark documents

* TODO "Dealing with Properties", Martin Fowler, https://www.martinfowler.com/apsupp/properties.pdf

* TODO evaluate typing difficulty of each identifier and syntax quantitatively.

- Can the syntax grammar be simplified without hurting readability and flexibility?
- Can the language itself/concepts be simplified without sacrificing readability and flexibility?
- Use easier synonyms for hard to type words?
- Bulk analyze source code out there.
- Frequency of syntax tokens, familiarity, ease of typing, speaking, identifiers.
