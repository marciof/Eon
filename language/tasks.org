* TODO add security as a goal

* TODO shell pipeline syntax?

- update grammar (comma as the pipe character) 
- add pipe examples in the function section 
- how are getopt flags handled? eg. `ls -la ./example`
  - every function argument is already quoted
- https://github.com/willghatch/racket-rash
- "Pipelines Support Vectorized, Point-Free, and Imperative Style", https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/01/15.html

# Symbols as "flags"?
# Unreserving backslash would allow it for division?
# And less/greater than or equal? 
# But reserves minus char?
# Just leave it to stdlib? 

{\name='Bob' \age=20}
{--name='Bob' --age=20}
{-name='Bob' -age=20}
{--name:'Bob' --age:20}
{-name:'Bob' -age:20} 

: 1 2
\ 1 2
<\ x y
<_ x y
<< x y
|< x y
>| x y

# More syntax for symbols and arguments?
# stdlib?

# ls -la --color=auto

ls \l=true \a=true \color='auto' 
ls color:`auto

# Keyword arguments won't be used much?
# Switch '=' to ':'? More readable?

# Only back compat for POSIX? 
# Use single letter tools instead (eg. show.sh) 

# Just quote left always, it's more common?
# More consistent? 
{name:'Bob' age:20}

# Make it multiple values to generalize? Orthogonal? 
# How to escape? 
# Unify symbols and strings? 

{\name:123}
{name=123}

`symbol

if [is user 'bob'] then=
  io/print {name='bob' age=[\ 20 1]} 

`Interpolated string\n` # not needed? 
[defer (list of strings and numbers 1 2 3 \[+ 1 3])]

# Over using keyword parameters? 
if [age < 20] ...
if [age <= 20] ...

# And function names? 
if [<= age 20] ...

# Math expression helper? 
if [expr age <= (max-age + 10)] ...

# Avoid reserving equals sign?

* TODO specify indentation based syntax grammar

- https://github.com/tonyg/racket-something
- https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html
- https://devguide.python.org/compiler/
- accept keyword arguments on indented lines as well?
  - use parenthesis to force a function call, as it‘s a more uniform syntax?
  - pass each line still as a single argument, to not deviate from other langs 
  - a varargs arg gets all args in a list, `then...`
  - a dangling keyword arg gets all args in an empty function list, `then=`
  - an empty function does nothing, evaluates its arguments (sequentially or in parallel?), and returns the last one 
- avoid `do` as a built-in? Otherwise it's too implicit? 
- A file is a list of expressions. 
  - an empty file is an empty list
  - stdin is also a list of expressions (list length isn’t known a priori?)
  - REPL is just stdin as a “file”
  - REPL can also use a file as input
  - file should be the same as a REPL?
  - REPL uses a custom evaluator
    - like `let*` per expression
    - with custom commands? Eg. help
    - (make its API public/embeddable)
  - `import` can evaluate list items
  - just like a file-wide `let*`
 
if [logged-in? user]
  this-first
  this-second

if [logged-in? user] then=
  this-first
  this-second

if [logged-in? user] then=do
  this-first
  this-second

if [logged-in? user] do
  this-first
  this-second

if [logged-in? user]
  then=
    this-first
    this-second
  else=
    that-first
    that-second

let
  name='Bob'
  age=20

# Globals without `let`
name='Bob'
age=20

* TODO revisit license?

- switch to European Union Public Licence?
- https://oppen.digital/memex/posts/tech/licenses/
- https://codeberg.org/oppenlab/oppen_license
- https://prosperitylicense.com/ 

* TODO fix site redirect

- transfer domain out of Google? https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/
- https://www.privacyguides.org/providers/dns/
- https://hstspreload.org/

* TODO lexical binding by default for safety?

- eg. `[n=, * n 2]`, What does inspecting see?

* TODO lint spec

- verify char hex codes in the grammar
- run code snippets
- ensure non-numbered bullet point lists are in alphabetical order

* TODO decouple interfaces from implementations

- Case in point: sets were implied to be insertion ordered by deriving them from maps. 

* TODO improve/clean documentation

- ensure use of open standards, eg. https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/master/standards.md#standards-used-in-delta-chat
- ensure sections are alphabetical for ease of use
- how do number keys and keyword parameters work in function lists? Do keywords alias number keys?
- function naming example (1st key is the name, 1st value is the body/a fn), eg. `\(incr: + x 1)`
- how to regularly ensure language goals are being met?
- be succinct, avoid fluff
- lexical and dynamic scope example (explain how `bindings` in fn lists affect their scope)
- use only: must, should, may? And explain each one like RFCs
- add references to each section, where needed, for prior art?
  - https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/671
  - https://github.com/ulid/spec#prior-art
- in examples, should the resulting output of each expression be `repr`-like?
- Function sub headings? Examples and conditions per section
- Language code snippet example right on the front page (simple example, and show-off powerful example)
- Runnable examples, eg. https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- start a changelog? (and do releases?)
  - https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
  - https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.rst 
  - https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/ChangeLog 
- ensure: simplicity, clarity, and frugality

Philosophy from Tildes:

"Use modern versions of simple, reliable, "boring" technology
There should need to be an extremely compelling reason to use a new or less-known technology to implement something if it could also be done with one of the reliable ones already being used.
This will, also, make it easier for people to understand and contribute to the open-source code when there are fewer pieces involved and the ones being used are generally well-known and well-documented."

* TODO create coding style linting tool (use unifiedjs or similar?)

* TODO how easy is it to convert a map to a function list? and other list operations? 

- can `merge` (with reducer param?) or `splice` replace all other operations? (get, put, remove, count)
- union, intersection
- get = intersection by key
- remove = symmetric difference
- changing types (down/up cast)

* TODO add a core built-in `has?`?

- decouple `insert`? setting from displacing

* TODO make `insert` accept where before at?

- Since maps are insertion ordered. 
- `(insert map key value [before])`
- `(insert set value [before])`

* TODO attempt to unify data types?

- separate map syntax is confusing with sets? would static typing with inference make it less of a problem?
- numbers are symbols that evaluate to themselves
- booleans are numbers restricted to either 0 or 1
- maps are the root
- merge lists/arrays with function lists? easily merge arg lists into fns? `[]` `()`
- make it easier to type function lists? use `[]`?

* TODO visual grammar diagram?

- validate grammar as part of the build anyway 
- Railroad Diagram Generator

* TODO support for streaming, iterators, delayed collections?

- stdlib or core?
- could be useful for shell pipelines?
- `next` is an iterator?
- generator expressions? JS yield?
- Can unify unwind with yield?

* TODO generalize `:` and `.` to multiple elements?

- would enable more uses, eg. `127.0.0.1`, `12:45:00`
- too much added syntax?

* TODO multiline nesting comments? triple quotes?

- Language ergonomics shouldn't need an IDE?

* TODO make `count` throw an error for built-ins or foreign values?

* TODO syntax for fractions?

- examples: line number, column number, size of maps, type of values, number numerator, denominator
- https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Feature-Detection-Is-Better-than-Version-Detection
- allow multiple versions of the same package (see Python venv)

  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24932701
  - https://www.brinckerhoff.org/scraps/joe-marshall-on-FEXPRS-and-DEFMACRO.txt
- macros instead of fexprs?
- arguments for quoted parameters aren’t automatically evaluated, but unquoted are?
- could allows early returns?
- could replace exceptions?
- potentially more performant?
- have quasi-quote and unquote?
- should `defer`'s `escape` accept multiple arguments?
